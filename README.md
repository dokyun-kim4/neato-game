# Introduction
Using OpenCV and a Neato, we will recreate the ‘red light green light’ game from the Netflix show *Squid Game*. The Neato will periodically rotate towards the players, and whoever is still moving gets eliminated from the game.

# TODOs

- [x] Implement motion detection mvp using YOLOv8
- [x] Implement sort
- [ ] Read about the math behind YOLOv8
- [ ] Implement motion detection using unique bounding box id
